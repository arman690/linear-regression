## linear-regression

Code Descriptions:
Imports and Setup:

1- Import necessary libraries like 'numpy', 'matplotlib', and 'copy'.
   %matplotlib inline is a magic command for Jupyter notebooks to display plots inline.
   'utils' is imported, presumably containing some utility functions (not provided).
2- Reading Data:

    The code reads data from a file named 'ex1data1.txt'.
    Each line in the file contains two comma-separated values, which are read into 'x_train' and 'y_train'.
3- Print and Data Shape:

    Prints the type and first five elements of 'x_train' and 'y_train'.
    Displays the shapes of both arrays and the number of training examples.
3- Plotting Data:

    A scatter plot is created using matplotlib to visualize the data points.
    The 'x-axis' represents the population of a city, and the 'y-axis' represents the profit.
4- Compute Cost Function:

    'compute_cost' computes the mean squared error (cost) between predicted values and actual values for given weights w and bias b.
5- Compute Gradient Function:

    'compute_gradient' calculates the gradients (derivatives) of the cost function with respect to weights w and bias b.
6- Gradient Descent:

    'gradient_descent' performs gradient descent optimization to minimize the cost function by adjusting weights w and bias b.
    Iteratively updates w and b using gradients until convergence or a specified number of iterations.
7- Linear Regression:

    The code initializes weights (initial_w) and bias (initial_b) to zeros.
    The gradient descent algorithm is applied to find the optimal w and b values that minimize the cost.
    The linear regression model is then plotted along with the original data points.
8- Prediction:

    Predictions are made for population values of 3.5 and 7.0 (in 10,000s) using the learned w and b.
    Predicted profits for these population values are printed.


# Linear Regression from Scratch

This repository contains Python code to perform linear regression from scratch using gradient descent optimization. The dataset used is stored in `ex1data1.txt`, where each line contains a population value and its corresponding profit.

## Contents:

1. `ex1data1.txt`: Dataset file containing population vs. profit data.
2. `utils.py`: A utility module (not provided in this snippet) for additional functions.
3. `linear_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for linear regression.

## Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arman690/linear-regression.git
